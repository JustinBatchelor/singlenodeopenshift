# Single Node OpenShift | Assisted Installer

## Description

Ansible automation that will stand up a single node OpenShift cluster on your local proxmox node using the assisted installer API [Red Hat Assisted Installer](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/installing-with-api#doc-wrapper). 

After running this automation successfully you should have a local OpenShift cluster running in your proxmox environment.

## Dependancies
- `python3.10+` is installed on your system

- `ansible` is installed on your system
    - for Debian distros (ex. Ubuntu) run the following command
        - `sudo apt install ansible` 
    - for RedHat distros (ex RHEL/Fedora) run the following command
        - `sudo dnf install ansible`
